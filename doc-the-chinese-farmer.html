   <h1 class="title">The story</h1>

      <p class="firstparagraph">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="quote">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em> </p>

      <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="quote">Oh dear, that’s too <em class="bad">bad</em>,</q> and the farmer responded, <em class="farmer">“Maybe.”</em> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="quote">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <b class="farmer">“Maybe.”</b></p>

     <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> fortune.</p>

         <h1>Conclusion </h1> 
         <p><em class="good">Good</em> and <em class="bad">Bad</em> are just one perspective. Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em class="good">good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
